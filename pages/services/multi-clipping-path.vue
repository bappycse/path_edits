          <p>The multiple path creation is a sub-category of the clipping path service. It is applied to the more complex images with multiple holes where the designer has to create paths separately multiple times. This is an advanced type of clipping path that involves the creation of a path in more than one detached area. The background of images like this is impossible to remove by a single path or regular clipping path service.
